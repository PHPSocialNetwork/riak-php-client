# Riak Client for PHP [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/riak-php-client.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/basho/riak-php-client)
A PHP client/toolkit for [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/), Basho's distributed database. This client library is officially supported and maintained by the Basho engineering team.

**NOTICE: THE 2.0.X BRANCH IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION AT THIS TIME**

## Releases
The release tags of this project have been aligned with the major & minor release versions of Riak. For example, if you are using version 1.4.9 of Riak, then you will want the latest 1.4.* version of this library.

## Dependencies
**Release 2.x.x**
* PHP 5.4+

**Release 1.4.x**
* PHP 5.3+

## Installation
### Composer Install
Run the following `composer` command:

```console
$ composer require "basho/riak-php-client:1.4.*"
```

Alternately, manually add the following to your `composer.json`, in the `require` section:

```javascript
"require": {
    "basho/riak-php-client": "1.4.*"
}
```

And then run `composer update` to ensure the module is installed.

## Documentation
API documentation for this library can be found on [Github Pages](http://basho.github.com/riak-php-client)

To see other clients available for use with Riak visit our
[Documentation Site](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/libraries)

## Examples
```php
use Basho\Riak;
use Basho\Riak\Node;
use Basho\Riak\Command;

$nodes = (new Node\Builder)
    ->onPort(10018)
    ->buildCluster(['riak1.company.com', 'riak2.company.com', 'riak3.company.com',]);

$riak = new Riak($nodes);

$command = (new Command\Builder\StoreObject($riak))
    ->buildObject('some_data')
    ->buildBucket('users')
    ->build();
    
$response = $command->execute($command);

$object_location = $response->getLocation();
```

## RoadMap
* Current develop & master branches contain the legacy 1.4.x release of this library.
* A Riak 2 rewrite is under active development in the 2.0.x branch
  * Shooting for a mid Q1 release candidate
  * Design goals are simplicity, extendability and stability
  * Follow PHP community standards for code style, docblock comments and use PHPUnit
  * Post questions, concerns and requests as Issues to open up a discussion
  * It will only use the HTTP Api for Riak at release
    * Decision was due to lack of PB library that doesn't depend on PHP extension with good PB message class generation
    * Plan for future by following Adapter design pattern so each API driver / adapter is interchangeable
  * It will make use of Traits, Abstract classes and Interfaces so app developers can extend and add any functionality they need

## Contributing
This is an open source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. We encourage and welcome contributions to the project from the community. We ask that you keep in mind these considerations when planning your contribution.

* Whether your contribution is for a bug fix or a feature request, create an Issue and let us know what you are thinking.
* For bugs, if you have already found a fix, feel free to submit a Pull Request referencing the Issue you created.
* For feature requests, we want to improve upon the library incrementally which means small changes at a time. In order ensure your PR can be reviewed in a timely manner, please keep PRs small, e.g. <10 files and <500 lines changed. If you think this is unrealistic, then mention that within the GH Issue and we can discuss it.
* Before you open the PR, please review the following regarding Coding Standards, Docblock comments and unit / integration tests to reduce delays in getting your changes approved.

### Coding Standards
Here are the standards we expect to see when considering pull requests

* [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
* [PHP / Pear Docblock Guide](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.sample.php)
* [PHPUnit Tests](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/phpunit-book.html)
* Please suffix all Interfaces and Traits with the descriptors Interface and Trait, e.g. ObjectInterface & ObjectTrait

### Docblock Comments
It is expected that any new code is updated with a reasonable docblock comment. 

This includes:

* Short & long descriptions (where appropriate) for all classes and all class members, properties and constants.
* Please add code examples where it makes sense using the <code> tag.
* A @author tag need to be included on all new classes.
* A @var tag on every class property
* A @param tag for every parameter on a class method
* A @return tag for every class method that returns a value
* A @throws tag for every method that has a thrown execution within it 

Here is an example of a class docblock:
```php
/**
 * A more elaborate description of what this class does. It may include warnings, limitations or examples.
 *
 * <code>
 * $nodes = (new Node\Builder)
 *   ->atHost('localhost')
 *   ->onPort(8098)
 *   ->build()
 *
 * $riak = new Riak($nodes);
 * </code>
 *
 * @author  Author Name <author@domain.com>
 */
```

It is not necessary to add short / long descriptions to simple getters & setters. Use the @since tag where appropriate.

### Tests
We want to ensure that all code that is included in a release has proper coverage with unit tests. It is expected that
all pull requests that include new classes or class methods have appropriate unit tests included with the PR.

There are three types of tests that we use, each has been setup within the phpunit.xml within the root of the library and are described below.
<dl>
<dt>Unit Tests</dt>
<dd>Focus is on each unit of work. It is the most verbose as each member of every class should be tested. These tests use mock objects, so they do not require a live Riak instance.</dd>
<dt>Functional Tests</dt>
<dd>Focus is on the functionality the user is likely to regularly execute, e.g. storing an object. These tests will connect to and use a live Riak instance.</dd>
<dt>Scenario Tests</dt>
<dd>Focus is on testing how the library and Riak respond to edge cases, e.g. how it handles when a node becomes unreachable. These tests will connect to and use a live Riak instance.</dd>
</dl>

#### Running Tests
We also expect that before submitting a pull request, that you have run the tests to ensure that all of them continue to pass after your changes.

To run the tests, clone this repository and run `composer update` from the repository root, then you can execute all the tests by simply running `php vendor/bin/phpunit`. To execute only a single group of tests, you can use the "testsuite" argument, e.g. `php vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite 'Unit Tests'`.

Please note, that the Functional and Scenario tests require a live Riak instance to test against.
